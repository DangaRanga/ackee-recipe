This repository was originally created to show how people could use GitHub to collaborate on an ``Ackee and Saltfish`` recipe. It now has multiple examples.

Add your own to the list or update existing ones. Here are some guidelines.

#. Whenever possible, use photos that are 600px wide. This makes the pages more consistent.
#. Always attribute the source of your images or recipes with URL links or text.
#. Keep the list below in alphabetical order

Give them a try!
